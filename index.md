### Class Progress

So far, my favorite thing I've done is make my own website. I created an about me page and a blog. It was created through VSCode and my Github repository. 

### Where To Go

To see my about page, you can press the about icon on the top. To see my blog about tools setup, go to blogs and then Github Pages blogs! The about page is all about me and has some interesting details about me. The blog is abour my journey for setting up tools in CSSE.
