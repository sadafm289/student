## What I Have Learned

I made a GitHub repository to successfully set me up for CSSE. I made a Tools and Equipment Issue shortly after to log my progress from day one!

Along with Github, I also used Slack to see class announcements and OpenCodingSociety.com for tools setup and calendar checks.

My first ever commit was my own website. At first, my website had an error because I made a mistake. I gave my GitHub repository a wrong name and this caused my website to look wrong. This was how my website looked when I first made it.

This was the first error I had so far in this class. I then renamed my repository and everything fixed! Now my website is functioning correctly. This error taught me to be careful and specific in what I do.

Overall, so far in CSSE, I have made my own GitHub repository, created my own website, and used Slack and OpenCodingSociety to communicate and progress successfully!
